One of the highlights of this journey was creating a weather application. It wasn't just about coding; it was about crafting a solution to a real-world problem. Managing APIs, juggling data, and creating a user-friendly interface were challenges that made the learning experience dynamic and rewarding. Through these projects, I've not only upped my Java game but also gained a broader perspective on the real-world applications of computer science. GitHub has become a second home, teaching me the art of collaborative coding and version control. In essence, this hands-on approach has transformed me into a more skilled and versatile programmer, making this journey a truly human and enriching experience. 

I used to code a lot as a kid when I did my Raspberry Pi Projects and CyberAegis, but this class above all else has let me level up as  coder, b/c I have been able to apply so many different projects and ideas. 



CPT PROJ



I'm really excited about the upcoming CPT project on a stock market analyzer. It's awesome because it combines my interest in finance with my love for computer science. I can't wait to dig into the financial intricacies, analyze market trends, and use my computer science skills to create a powerful tool. This project feels like the perfect opportunity to merge my two passions, and I'm all in to make it a success. This seems like a pretty cool tool that even I Could use in my own future in finance.
