Q6: 
The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom left square of the grid and facing right.

The figure presents a robot in a grid of squares with 5 rows and 4 columns. The robot is represented by a triangle which is initially in the lower left square of the grid, facing right. The grid contains a gray square in the first row and third column of the grid.
The following programs are each intended to move the robot to the gray square. Program II uses the procedure GoalReached, which returns true if the robot is in the gray square and returns false otherwise.

Selected Answer: A (Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square, but program II does not.)

Correct Answer: C (Both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square.)

This is because if you carefully follow the steps program 2 actually works, this was just a silly mistake.
