Why the Wrong Answers Are Wrong:

B: Turning chat off doesn't involve the community. It's just a setting change.
C: Software doing the monitoring is about technology, not people helping out.
D: Updating rules and making people sign them is a company action, not asking players to help.

Correct Answer:
A: This option is about players giving thumbs-up to other nice players. It's using the crowd (all the players) to find and reward the good ones. When enough players say someone is great, that person gets a gift in the game. This is what crowdsourcing is all about: getting everyone to chip in.

Why the Wrong Answers Are Wrong:

B: Guessing a common password is just trial and error. No special tool like keylogging is used.
C: Watching data on an unsecure website is about intercepting, not recording keystrokes.
D: This is phishing, tricking you into giving away your info, not keylogging.

Correct Answer:
A: This one's about a sneaky program that records what you type, like passwords, and sends it to someone else. That's exactly what keylogging does: track and send your keystrokes to someone who shouldn't have them.

### q 47

Option A: This will filter for restaurants with an average rating greater than or equal to 4.0 AND a price range of "lo" AND a price range of "med". This is impossible because a restaurant cannot have both "lo" and "med" as its price range simultaneously, hence it's incorrect.

Option C: This will filter for restaurants with an average rating greater than or equal to 4.0 OR a price range of "lo" AND NOT "med". This is incorrect because it would include all restaurants with high ratings regardless of price and all low-cost restaurants regardless of rating.

Option D: This will filter for restaurants with an average rating greater than or equal to 4.0 OR a price range of "lo" OR a price range of "med". This is incorrect because it would include all restaurants with high ratings, all low-cost restaurants, and all medium-cost restaurants, regardless of their rating.


Correct Answer: 
Option B: This will filter for restaurants with an average rating greater than or equal to 4.0 AND a price range of either "lo" OR "med". This is the correct logic because it allows for restaurants in either the "lo" or "med" price range, not both at the same time.

Why the Wrong Answers Are Wrong:

A: While human validation may be necessary for some outputs, this doesn't explain the core concept that some problems inherently cannot be solved by any algorithm.
B: Using multiple devices in parallel can speed up processing but doesn't affect whether a problem can be algorithmically solved at its core.
C: The amount of data storage available doesn't determine the solvability of a problem algorithmically. It might affect performance or feasibility but not the fundamental ability to solve a problem.

Correct Answer: 
D is correct because there are indeed some problems that can't be solved by any algorithm. This is a fundamental principle in computer science related to computability theory. Some problems are undecidable, meaning no algorithm can be written to solve them for all possible inputs.

Why the Wrong Answers Are Wrong:

B: Monitoring cell growth in a lab requires controlled conditions and specialized equipment, which is not feasible for the average citizen.
C: Running simulations with chemicals and determining their impact on ecosystems would require specific scientific expertise and access to simulation software, which isn't generally available to the public.
D: Performing 3D scans of proteins requires highly specialized equipment and knowledge, making it unsuitable for citizen science.

Correct Answer
A

A citizen science project is most likely to be successful if it's accessible to the general public and allows for widespread participation. Collecting pictures of birds from around the world (A) is something that many people can do easily, as it doesn't require specialized knowledge or equipment, just a camera or smartphone. This makes it perfect for citizen science, where volunteers contribute data for scientific research.

### Question 3

RunRoutr is a fitness tracking application for smartphones that creates suggested running routes so that users can run with each other. Upon downloading the application, each user creates a username, a personal profile, and a contact list of friends who also use the application. The application uses the smartphone’s GPS unit to track a user’s location, running speed, and distance traveled. Users can use the application to review information and statistics about their previous runs.

At the beginning of a run, users indicate the distance they want to run from their current location, and the application suggests a running route. Once a user accepts a suggested route, the application shares the suggested route with other compatible users in the area so that they can run together. Users are considered compatible if they are on each other’s contact lists or if they typically run at similar speeds.

A basic RunRoutr account is free, but it displays advertisements that are targeted to individual users based on data collected by the application. For example, if a user’s running route begins or ends near a particular store, the application may display an advertisement for that store. Users have the ability to pay a monthly fee for a premium account, which removes advertisements from the application.

- [ ] A. Available running routes near the user’s home
- [ ] B. The current time
- [ ] C. The starting location of the user’s previous run
- [ ] D. The user’s geographic position

### Question 4
