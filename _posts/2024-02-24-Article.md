### Student-Developed Procedure Requirements

#### i. Define the Procedure’s Name, Return Type, and Parameters

**Requirement Met:** The `fetchStocks` function is a student-developed procedure that fulfills the following:

- **Procedure's Name:** `fetchStocks`
- **Return Type:** Implicitly returns `Promise<void>` due to its asynchronous nature (`async` keyword), although this is not explicitly defined in JavaScript.
- **Parameters:** This is the only requirement not exactly met b/c my function can't exactly take different parameters b/c it will get the 

```javascript
async function fetchStocks() {
    // Initialization and fetch operations here
}
```

#### ii. Implements an Algorithm with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration

**Requirement Met:** Within `fetchStocks`, we implement an algorithm that includes:

- **Sequencing:** The function sequentially fetches stock data, processes each stock, and updates the UI.
- **Selection:** Uses conditional logic (`profitLoss >= 0 ? 'profit' : 'loss'`) to determine the class for profit/loss display.
- **Iteration:** Iterates over the fetched stock data using `stocks.forEach(stock => {...})`.

```javascript
async function fetchStocks() {
    let overallBalance = 0;
    const response = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8055/api/stock/stocks');
    const stocks = await response.json();

    const stocksTableBody = document.getElementById('stocksTable').getElementsByTagName('tbody')[0];
    stocksTableBody.innerHTML = '';

    stocks.forEach(stock => {
        const profitLoss = (stock.current_price - stock.purchase_price) * stock.shares;
        overallBalance += profitLoss;
        const row = stocksTableBody.insertRow();
        // Cell content setup here
        const profitLossCell = row.insertCell(4);
        profitLossCell.textContent = profitLoss.toFixed(2);
        profitLossCell.className = profitLoss >= 0 ? 'profit' : 'loss';
    });

    document.getElementById('overallBalance').textContent = `Overall Balance: $${overallBalance.toFixed(2)}`;
    document.getElementById('overallBalance').className = overallBalance >= 0 ? 'profit' : 'loss';
}
```

#### iii. Procedure Call in the Program

**Requirement Met:** The `fetchStocks` function is called right after its definition, ensuring the stock table is populated as soon as the page loads or the script is executed.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fetchStocks);
```

This demonstrates the integration of the student-developed procedure into the program, fulfilling its purpose of fetching and displaying stock data upon initialization.

### List Management Requirements

#### i. Storing Data in a List

**Requirement Met:** The following code segment demonstrates data being stored in a list (array) after fetching from the backend. This array (`stocks`) manages complex data structures by organizing stock information into an iterable format.

```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8055/api/stock/stocks');
const stocks = await response.json();
```

#### ii. Utilizing List Data

**Requirement Met:** The utilization of the `stocks` array is shown in the processing and UI updating part of the `fetchStocks` function. This demonstrates creating new data from existing data (calculating profit/loss) and accessing multiple elements in the list to fulfill the program's purpose.

```javascript
stocks.forEach(stock => {
    const profitLoss = (stock.current_price - stock.purchase_price) * stock.shares;
    // UI update operations here
});
```

This code segment not only iterates over the list to access and manipulate data but also dynamically updates the web page based on the content of the same list, showcasing effective complexity management within the program.

Each of these segments explicitly meets the outlined requirements, demonstrating how my code incorporates a student-developed procedure with sequencing, selection, and iteration, and how it effectively manages complexity through the use of lists for storing and utilizing data.
