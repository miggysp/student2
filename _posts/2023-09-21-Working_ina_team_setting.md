- Working in a team setting offers numerous benefits. Firstly it brings toghter people with varying skills and perspectives. This leads to quicker solutions and innovative ideas. Group members can also complement each other's strengths and compensate for weaknesses. It also takes pressure off of each group member. I was in CyberAegis so I have scripting experience and making programs more efficient. Anagha and Drishya a have a lot of coding expierence. Tanvi is very creative and can help us create outside the box solutions to problems.  

- To facilitate communication we will establish clear group objectives, use groupchats to stay connected, check-in regulary on zoom, and document what we did everyday. 

- When we make our week plans we will have clear task assignments with deadlines. This will help us make sure that all the work is completed and also completed by the right people.
