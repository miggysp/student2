Throughout this trimester, I particularly enjoyed the hands-on experience of building APIs, which enhanced my understanding of data transmission and interaction between different software applications. Additionally, the exploration of Python functions equipped me with the essential skills needed to streamline code execution and foster efficient problem-solving strategies. Looking ahead, I am eager to apply these newfound skills in upcoming projects and deepen my understanding of advanced programming concepts.

I really liked how hands on this class is and it gives a good change from just listening to lectures all day
